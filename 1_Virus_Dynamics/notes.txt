Notes for Day1:

Problem 1:

b) This model can describe the spike in the acute phase and the equilibrium of the chronic phase. Simulation of the AIDS phase of a HIV would 
not be possible with this model.

c)Dt > 0.1 is timestep to big: simulation happens much faster handle to big timesteps with 1000 steps. When time steps are too small then the change in both 
groups gives higher resolution. Dt determines the speed of environmental change.

d)In case of high production and clearance are equal, the models beta stays constant. The new model considers reproductive  succes and its resistance 
to immune responses of the cell.
